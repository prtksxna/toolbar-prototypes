He is considered among the most influential figures of <a href="/wiki/Anarchism" title="Anarchism">anarchism</a>, and one of the principal founders of the <a href="/wiki/Social_anarchism" title="Social anarchism">social anarchist</a> tradition.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">[2]</a></sup> Bakunin's enormous prestige as an activist made him one of the most famous ideologues in Europe, and he gained substantial influence among radicals throughout Russia and Europe.</p>
<p>Bakunin grew up in <a href="/wiki/Kuvshinovsky_District" title="Kuvshinovsky District">Pryamukhino</a>, a family estate in <a href="/wiki/Tver_Governorate" title="Tver Governorate">Tver Governorate</a>, where he moved to study philosophy and began to read the French <a href="/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A9distes" title="Encyclopédistes">encyclopédistes</a>, leading to enthusiasm for the philosophy of <a href="/wiki/Johann_Gottlieb_Fichte" title="Johann Gottlieb Fichte">Fichte</a>. From Fichte, Bakunin went on to immerse himself in the works of <a href="/wiki/Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel" title="Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel">Hegel</a>, the most influential thinker among German intellectuals at the time. That led to his embrace of <a href="/wiki/Hegelianism" title="Hegelianism">Hegelianism</a>, bedazzled by Hegel's famous maxim, "Everything that exists is rational." In 1840, Bakunin traveled to <a href="/wiki/St._Petersburg" class="mw-redirect" title="St. Petersburg">St. Petersburg</a> and Berlin with the intention of preparing himself for a professorship in philosophy or history at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Moscow" class="mw-redirect" title="University of Moscow">University of Moscow</a>. In 1842, Bakunin moved from Berlin to Dresden. Eventually he arrived in Paris, where he met <a href="/wiki/Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon" title="Pierre-Joseph Proudhon">Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</a> and <a href="/wiki/Karl_Marx" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a>.</p>
<p>Bakunin's increasing radicalism – including staunch opposition to imperialism in east and central Europe by Russia and other powers – changed his life, putting an end to hopes of a professorial career. He was eventually deported from France for speaking against Russia's oppression of Poland. In 1849, Bakunin was apprehended in Dresden for his participation in the <a href="/wiki/Revolutions_of_1848" title="Revolutions of 1848">Czech rebellion of 1848</a>, and turned over to Russia where he was imprisoned in the <a href="/wiki/Peter_and_Paul_Fortress" title="Peter and Paul Fortress">Peter-Paul Fortress</a> in <a href="/wiki/Saint_Petersburg" title="Saint Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a>. He remained there until 1857, when he was exiled to a work camp in Siberia. Escaping to Japan, the US and finally ending up in London for a short time, he worked with <a href="/wiki/Alexander_Herzen" title="Alexander Herzen">Alexander Herzen</a> on the journal <i>Kolokol</i> (<i>The Bell</i>). In 1863, he left to join the <a href="/wiki/January_Uprising" title="January Uprising">insurrection in Poland</a>, but he failed to reach his destination and instead spent some time in Switzerland and Italy.</p>
